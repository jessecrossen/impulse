JACKDAW is a Digital Audio Workstation (or DAW), based on the [JACK Audio Connection Kit](http://jackaudio.org/). It's essentially an intuitive graphical patchbay with a built-in MIDI sequencer, allowing you to connect MIDI instruments with tools like [LinuxSampler](http://www.linuxsampler.org/) and (coming soon) audio processing or soft-synth plugins based on [LADSPA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LADSPA), [DSSI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disposable_Soft_Synth_Interface), or [LV2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LV2). All these tools are started, stopped, and managed by JACKDAW, so that you can save and restore your complete setup at any time. JACKDAW is written in [Python 2](https://www.python.org/), using [QT](http://qt-project.org/)'s [PySide bindings](http://qt-project.org/wiki/PySide) for the GUI and the [jackpatch module](https://github.com/jessecrossen/python-jackpatch) to interface with JACK. Right now, the application is in the alpha stage of development, so it isn't packaged with an installer or anything to make it easy to run, and the interface is still in flux so there isn't any documentation yet. Please check back in a few months if you just want to get it running and fool around.
