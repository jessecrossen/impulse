impulse
=======

Impulse is a simple MIDI sequencer, designed for rapidly sketching musical ideas. It uses Python and GTK3+ 
via the PyGObject bindings, and at this point will only run on Linux. It's not ready for widespread use yet, 
but feel free to borrow code or try and get it working yourself.
