ON DECK:
- add cc output routing
- add a method of deleting ccs
- add a method of editing ccs
- add a unit to show midi messages in realtime

DEFECTS:
- scrollbar is no longer working correctly with transport tracking
- more undoable actions: moving unit, resizing unit, adding patch, recording

FEATURES:
- tracks can be deleted
- make a control surface for mix/pan visualization/control
- block backgrounds can be colored, color follows eventlist linkages
- unit backgrounds can be colored
- special grouping unit which moves all units inside it when moved
- allow blocks to be moved between tracks
- make logo and rename project
- write or adapt a standalone JACK LV2 and/or DSSI effects host
- add a unit for effects processing
- key modifier for proportional stretch of a block's events
- notes embed pitch modulation and aftertouch, keyed by fraction of note duration
- notes respond to pitch modulation and aftertouch by warping the rectangle
- resizing a unit pushes connected units along with the edges
- selectable protocols for transport control
- midi file import/export for block event lists

OPTIMIZATIONS:
- add an alternate file format that's faster than YAML (cPickle)
- optimize state saving and deletion process (use serialization)
- limit time spent processing midi messages per-pass to maintain responsiveness
