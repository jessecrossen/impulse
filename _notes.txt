- make filters that can alter the characteristics of underlying notes at play-time (e.g. quantize, timewarp)
- general curve editing for control channel events in a block
- notes embed pitch modulation and aftertouch, keyed by fraction of note duration
- notes respond to pitch modulation and aftertouch by warping the rectangle
- allow dragging/snapping of marks
- block backgrounds can be colored, color follows eventlist linkages
- routable control channels on each track
