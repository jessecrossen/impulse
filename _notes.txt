ON DECK:
- add cc output routing
- show cc previews when track is armed
- add a method of deleting ccs
- add a method of editing ccs

DEFECTS:
- scrollbar is no longer working correctly with transport tracking
- more undoable actions: moving unit, resizing unit, adding patch

FEATURES:
- make a control surface for mix/pan visualization/control
- block backgrounds can be colored, color follows eventlist linkages
- unit backgrounds can be colored
- special grouping unit which moves all units inside it when moved
- allow blocks to be moved between tracks
- make logo and rename project
- write or adapt a standalone JACK LV2 and/or DSSI effects host
- add a unit for effects processing
- key modifier for proportional stretch of a block's events
- notes embed pitch modulation and aftertouch, keyed by fraction of note duration
- notes respond to pitch modulation and aftertouch by warping the rectangle

OPTIMIZATIONS:
- consider an alternate file format that's faster than YAML
- optimize state saving and deletion process
- limit time spent processing midi messages per-pass to maintain responsiveness
