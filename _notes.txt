- note input
- instrument selection
- midi serialization
- accelerators are not working right
- pan should be a spinning arrow indicating apparent direction
- make filters that can alter the characteristics of underlying notes at play-time (e.g. quantize, timewarp)
- general curve editing for control channel events in a block (BlockView => NotesView)
- notes embed pitch modulation and aftertouch, keyed by fraction of note duration
- notes respond to pitch modulation and aftertouch by warping the rectangle
- functions to join and clone blocks (keeping or cloning the event list reference)
- add marks as snaps, allow dragging/snapping of marks
